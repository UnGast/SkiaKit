SkiaKit is a 2D Graphics Library for use with Swift.   It is powered by Google's
[Skia](https://skia.org) graphics library, the same library that powers Google Chrome 
and Android graphics.

You can review the [API Documentation](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SkiaKit/)

The Swift bindings are intended to be cross-platform, both to Apple platforms, and
new platforms where Skia and Swift run.

This work uses extensive code from Microsoft's SkiaSharp bindings authoered by 
Matthew Leibowitz and dozens of contributors.   SkiaSharp just happens to have
a very advanced set of bridge APIs to the underlying Skia engine that does not 
existin in the upstream Google Skia project.

## Getting this to work locally

You can either download and install the SkiaSharp.nuget package, or
build your own local copy of Mono's Skia fork
(https://github.com/mono/skia/tree/77049b872966dc300ed233fc6e3930eb21bac5e3
from https://github.com/mono/skiasharp).

The `download-payload.sh` script automates the download, but relies on Mono
to be installed for extracting the payload from the DLLs (the iOS/tvOS frameworks
live inside a Zip file called libSkiaSharp.framework inside a resource in the
SkiaSharp.dll)

```
SkiaKit/iOS:
	Copy the iOS directory libSkiaSharp.framework here
SkiaKit/macOS:
	Copy the file libSkiaSharp.dylib here
SkiaKit/tvOS:
	Copy the tvOS directory libSkiaSharp.framework here
```
